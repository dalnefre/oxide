[Oxide](READMD.md) has a very small asynchronous message-passing micro-kernel on which all other facilities are built.
The three most important design requirements are:
  * Low latency
  * High throughput
  * Provable safety

Low latency is achieved by ...

High throughput is achieved by ...

Provable safety is achieved by ...
